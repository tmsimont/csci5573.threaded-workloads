# Looping programs

These are here to provide simple processes to contend with `matmul` for CPU time.

## busyWait

This is a multi-threaded program that will launch the given number of threads as simple busy waiting processes.

## loopy

This is a single-threaded process that will simply loop. `launch-loops.sh` allows you to specify how many of these processes to launch into the background with a given nice level.
